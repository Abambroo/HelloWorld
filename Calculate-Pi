how to calculate pi:

consider the diameter of a circle is 1

pi is ratio of diameter to circumference.

split circle up into many segments (eg 360)

consider each segment a triangle

two sides are length 0.5 each. Angle is 360/no of segments
calculate the other length.

multiply the length by the number of segments (eg 360).

The more segments you have the nearer to pi you will get.
